**Technical Report on Software Development Project Preparation**

As the Software Team Lead, I am pleased to provide an overview of the preparatory activities undertaken for our upcoming software development project. Recognizing the pivotal role of cloud technology in contemporary software engineering, our team has engaged in comprehensive training in AWS cloud management. Additionally, I have obtained certification as a Cloud Architect, aligning our skills with industry best practices in cloud rendering and computing.

The decision to leverage AWS for our project stems from its reputation for easy deployment, scalability, and robust security features. Cloud technology, while offering significant advantages, presents its own set of complexities. To proactively address these challenges, I have pursued relevant certifications, ensuring our team is well-equipped to navigate the intricacies of cloud-based solutions.

In anticipation of team composition, I have developed custom Machine Images (Amazon Machine Image - AMI). These images encapsulate not only the necessary API and code lines but also simulated CAD OEM plugins. This strategic move aims to provide a clear technical blueprint for our prospective software development team, facilitating a seamless onboarding process and promoting uniformity in our development environment.

Currently, we have established an AWS (root) account under the free-tier subscription. This foundational setup positions us for efficient scaling as the team comes together, seamlessly transitioning to a business-tier subscription to accommodate the demands of our project. These initiatives collectively underscore our commitment to a technologically advanced and well-prepared approach to the software development endeavor.
